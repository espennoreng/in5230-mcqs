    B. Number, String, Boolean, undefined, null, Symbol, BigInt
    C. Function, Class

    A. Array, Object, Set, Date
    B. Number, Boolean
    C. String
    D. Symbol
    Answer: A

    D. <>
    Answer: B
    Explanation: Curly braces.

18) What is hoisted differently among var/let/const?
    A. All identical
    B. var is function-scoped and initialized to undefined; let/const are TDZ until initialized
    C. const is hoisted to globalThis
    D. let becomes global
    Answer: B
    Explanation: Temporal Dead Zone for let/const.

19) Which examples shows function as a value?
    A. const f = 42
    B. const f = (x) => x + 1
    C. class f {}
    D. import f from 'x'
    Answer: B

    D. a['1'] only
    Answer: C
    Explanation: Zero-based indexing.

23) Objects are:
    A. Ordered lists
    B. Key/value collections with string/symbol keys
    C. Only number keys
    D. Immutable by default
    Answer: B

    Answer: A
    Explanation: Dot or bracket notation.

25) Which is true about methods on String?
